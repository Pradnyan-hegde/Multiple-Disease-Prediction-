Expanding your **Multiple Disease Prediction** project to include more diseases can make it more robust and impactful. Here are some suggestions, grouped by category, along with the typical features or data you may need for each:

---

### **1. Chronic Diseases**
   - **Hypertension (High Blood Pressure)**  
     Features: Age, weight, BMI, blood pressure readings, cholesterol levels, lifestyle habits (e.g., smoking, alcohol consumption).
   - **Kidney Disease**  
     Features: Serum creatinine, albumin levels, blood urea nitrogen, diabetes status, hypertension history.
   - **Liver Disease**  
     Features: Liver enzyme levels (ALT, AST), bilirubin, albumin, and alcohol consumption history.

---

### **2. Neurological Disorders**
   - **Alzheimerâ€™s Disease**  
     Features: Cognitive test scores, MRI scans, patient age, genetics (e.g., APOE gene).
   - **Epilepsy**  
     Features: EEG data, seizure history, patient age, genetic predisposition.
   - **Stroke Risk**  
     Features: Blood pressure, smoking status, cholesterol, physical activity levels, and past heart-related conditions.

---

### **3. Respiratory Diseases**
   - **Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)**  
     Features: Lung function tests (e.g., FEV1), smoking history, age, and chronic cough history.
   - **Asthma**  
     Features: Spirometry readings, allergy history, exposure to allergens, and patient age.

---

### **4. Cancer Predictions**
   - **Breast Cancer**  
     Features: Tumor size, lump characteristics, mammography results, genetics (e.g., BRCA1/BRCA2).
   - **Lung Cancer**  
     Features: Smoking history, CT scan results, age, air quality exposure.
   - **Colon Cancer**  
     Features: Age, family history, polyp detection, dietary habits.

---

### **5. Infectious Diseases**
   - **Tuberculosis (TB)**  
     Features: X-ray results, sputum tests, weight loss history, and travel/exposure history.
   - **Malaria**  
     Features: Blood test results (e.g., RBC count), fever patterns, geographical location.

---

### **6. Autoimmune Disorders**
   - **Rheumatoid Arthritis**  
     Features: Joint pain, inflammation markers (CRP, ESR), anti-CCP antibodies.
   - **Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)**  
     Features: ANA test results, rash presence, fatigue levels.

---

### **7. Lifestyle-Related Diseases**
   - **Obesity Prediction**  
     Features: BMI, physical activity level, dietary intake, genetics.
   - **Sleep Apnea**  
     Features: Snoring history, BMI, neck circumference, sleep study data.

---

### **8. Mental Health Disorders**
   - **Depression**  
     Features: Questionnaire scores, sleep patterns, activity levels, social interaction history.
   - **Anxiety Disorders**  
     Features: Stress levels, physical symptoms (e.g., heart rate), psychological test results.

### **Additional Notes for Implementation**
1. **Data Availability**: Choose diseases based on the availability of reliable datasets. Public datasets like those from **Kaggle**, **UCI Machine Learning Repository**, or **NIH** can help.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Focus on collecting meaningful features for each disease to improve prediction accuracy.
3. **Multilabel Classification**: For simultaneous disease prediction, implement a multilabel classification approach.
4. **User Input**: Design the system to handle varied inputs (e.g., patient demographics, symptoms, test results).
